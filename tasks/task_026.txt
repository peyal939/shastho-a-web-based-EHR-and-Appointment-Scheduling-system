# Task ID: 26
# Title: Task #26: Establish Frontend Design Guidelines and Component Library
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze the frontendExamples/ folder to establish comprehensive frontend design guidelines, document design patterns, create reusable components, and define coding standards that align with existing design conventions.
# Details:
This high-priority task involves a thorough analysis of the frontendExamples/ folder to create a unified design system for the application. The developer should:

1. Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all UI elements in the frontendExamples/ folder, categorizing them by type (buttons, forms, navigation, layouts, etc.)
2. Document the existing color palette, typography, spacing, and responsive design approaches
3. Identify common interaction patterns and behaviors (hover states, animations, error handling)
4. Create a component library with the following:
   - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, selectors, modals)
   - Composite components (forms, cards, navigation bars)
   - Layout templates and grid systems
5. Establish coding standards for:
   - Component structure and naming conventions
   - CSS/SCSS organization and methodology (BEM, SMACSS, etc.)
   - JavaScript/TypeScript patterns for component behavior
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance level)
   - Responsive design breakpoints and approach
6. Document all guidelines in a centralized location (e.g., Storybook, Figma, or dedicated documentation site)
7. Create examples of proper implementation for each component
8. Establish a process for extending the design system with new components

This task is a critical dependency for all frontend-related work and should be completed before substantial frontend development begins on features like the Hospital Admin Views or Account Management interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task should be verified through the following steps:

1. Documentation Review:
   - Ensure all design patterns are thoroughly documented with visual examples
   - Verify that color palette, typography, spacing guidelines are clearly defined
   - Confirm that coding standards are specific and actionable

2. Component Library Validation:
   - Create a test page that renders all components in various states
   - Verify each component against the examples in frontendExamples/
   - Test components across different screen sizes to validate responsive behavior
   - Run accessibility tests (using tools like axe, Lighthouse) on all components

3. Developer Experience Testing:
   - Have 2-3 developers attempt to implement a simple UI feature using only the guidelines
   - Collect feedback on clarity and completeness of documentation
   - Identify any gaps or ambiguities in the guidelines

4. Integration Testing:
   - Apply the design system to an existing feature (e.g., a portion of Task #24 or #25)
   - Verify visual consistency with frontendExamples/
   - Measure implementation time to assess efficiency gains

5. Stakeholder Review:
   - Present the design system to project stakeholders
   - Demonstrate how it maintains consistency with existing design
   - Get formal approval that the guidelines satisfy project requirements

The task is considered complete when all documentation is finalized, the component library is implemented, and at least one feature has been successfully built using the new guidelines.
