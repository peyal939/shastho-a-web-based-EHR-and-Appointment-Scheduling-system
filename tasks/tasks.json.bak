Component Library Validation:\n   - Create a test page that renders all components in various states\n   - Verify each component against the examples in frontendExamples/\n   - Test components across different screen sizes to validate responsive behavior\n   - Run accessibility tests (using tools like axe, Lighthouse) on all components\n\n3. Developer Experience Testing:\n   - Have 2-3 developers attempt to implement a simple UI feature using only the guidelines\n   - Collect feedback on clarity and completeness of documentation\n   - Identify any gaps or ambiguities in the guidelines\n\n4. Integration Testing:\n   - Apply the design system to an existing feature (e.g., a portion of Task #24 or #25)\n   - Verify visual consistency with frontendExamples/\n   - Measure implementation time to assess efficiency gains\n\n5. Stakeholder Review:\n   - Present the design system to project stakeholders\n   - Demonstrate how it maintains consistency with existing design\n   - Get formal approval that the guidelines satisfy project requirements\n\nThe task is considered complete when all documentation is finalized, the component library is implemented, and at least one feature has been successfully built using the new guidelines.",

Registration process: Outline the steps involved in registering a new Test Admin, including any required approvals. Describe the `register_test_admin` route in `auth.py`, the `register_test_admin.html` form template, the initial `INACTIVE` status of new accounts, and the warning message displayed to users.\n\n3.

Approval workflow: Describe the complete approval workflow, including all states, transitions, and actions. Use a diagram or flowchart to illustrate the workflow. Detail the registration process, initial `INACTIVE` status, Hospital Admin review, status change upon approval (from `INACTIVE` to `ACTIVE`), login access after approval, and the outcome of rejection (status remains `INACTIVE`).\n\nThe document should be written in clear, concise language and should be suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.",
