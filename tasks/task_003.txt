# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a simple database-based authentication system for user login, logout, and session management, ensuring frontend components follow design patterns from frontendExamples/.
# Details:
1. Create User model with password hashing using bcrypt
2. Implement login route that validates credentials against database
3. Create session management using Flask-Session
4. Implement logout functionality
5. Create middleware for role-based access control
6. Implement decorators for route protection based on user roles
7. Create utility functions for password generation (for admin-created accounts)
8. Set up password hashing and verification functions
9. Create login form template with username/password fields following design patterns in frontendExamples/
10. Implement CSRF protection
11. Create error handling for authentication failures
12. Ensure registration form follows design conventions in frontendExamples/
13. Apply consistent styling to authentication components matching frontendExamples/ design patterns
14. Implement responsive design for authentication forms as shown in frontendExamples/

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user creation with password hashing
2. Verify login with correct and incorrect credentials
3. Test session creation and persistence
4. Verify logout functionality clears session
5. Test role-based access control for different user types
6. Verify CSRF protection works correctly
7. Test password generation utility
8. Verify frontend authentication components match design patterns from frontendExamples/
9. Test responsive behavior of authentication forms on different screen sizes
10. Validate that error messages display according to design conventions
