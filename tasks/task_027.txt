# Task ID: 27
# Title: Document Test/Imaging Admin Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a summary task that describes the recent implementation of the Test/Imaging Admin functionality, including user roles, registration, approval interfaces, schema changes, and workflow.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive summary document detailing the implementation of the Test/Imaging Admin functionality. The document should include the following sections:

1.  Test Admin user role and model: Describe the new user role, its permissions, and the data model used to represent Test Admins. Include details on the `TEST_ADMIN` enum value added to the `UserRole` enum in `database.py`, and the `TestAdmin` model class with its fields (`id`, `user_id`, `full_name`, `hospital_id`, `contact_number`, `department`, `qualification`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`).

2.  Registration process: Outline the steps involved in registering a new Test Admin, including any required approvals. Describe the `register_test_admin` route in `auth.py`, the `register_test_admin.html` form template, the initial `INACTIVE` status of new accounts, and the warning message displayed to users.

3.  Hospital Admin approval interface: Document the interface used by Hospital Admins to approve or reject Test Admin registration requests. Include details on the pending Test Admin count displayed on the Hospital Admin dashboard, the `pending_test_admins.html` template (including the list of pending applications, details displayed, and Approve/Reject buttons), and the validation logic ensuring Hospital Admins can only approve Test Admins for their own hospital.

4.  Database schema changes: Detail all changes made to the database schema to support the Test/Imaging Admin functionality, including new tables, columns, and relationships. Provide the `test_admin_migration.sql` script for the `test_admins` table, the indexes added for `user_id` and `hospital_id` fields, the `AdminRequestStatus` enum (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`), and the `TestImageAdminRequest` model.

5.  Approval workflow: Describe the complete approval workflow, including all states, transitions, and actions. Use a diagram or flowchart to illustrate the workflow. Detail the registration process, initial `INACTIVE` status, Hospital Admin review, status change upon approval (from `INACTIVE` to `ACTIVE`), login access after approval, and the outcome of rejection (status remains `INACTIVE`).

The document should be written in clear, concise language and should be suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

# Test Strategy:
The summary document will be reviewed by the project lead and senior developers to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Each section of the document will be verified against the actual implementation to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of the system. Specific attention will be paid to the database schema changes and the approval workflow to ensure that they are correctly documented. The document will also be reviewed by a technical writer to ensure that it is well-written and easy to understand. The review should specifically check that the documented workflow matches the implemented registration and approval process, and that all database changes are accurately represented in the documentation.
